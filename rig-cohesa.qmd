## A One Health Scope

<br/>

* A focus on zoonotic diseases based on Africa CDCâ€™s Framework for One Health Practice in National Public Health Institutes (2020), and Event Based Surveillance Framework (2018)

    - **Activities**, **Researchers**, and **Topics** that are

    - Related to **zoonotic disease**: infectious diseases that can be spread between animals and humans; can be spread by food, water, fomites or vectors
    
    - In or related to **African countries**

## Development updates

<br/>

* Africa CDC colleagues are integrating the database to the Knowledge Hub

* Updating database with new sources and funders then will add activities and researchers

    * search for new funders led to Pandemic PACT initiative - lots of overlap with database and has more records (9000+)
    
* Streamlining of fields in the main tables for **Activities** and **Researchers**
